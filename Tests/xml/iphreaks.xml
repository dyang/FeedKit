  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chuck dives into the 3 essentials for getting the next successful outcome you want in your career. Whether that&#39;s something simple like a raise or something more complex like going freelance, you can achieve it by working on 3 main areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, building skills. The most obvious type of skills you&#39;ll need is technical skills. However, don&#39;t neglect your people skills and your organizational skills as well since you&#39;re often paid for how you work with people and enhance their work and how you put your work together in the most efficient ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, building relationships. Often other people will be able to help you find the opportunities or will be the ones to make the decisions that impact your ability to get the outcome you want. Having good relationships is key to having good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, building recognition. Being known for being valuable in important ways allows you to leverage the skills you have to build better relationships and create opportunities to get what you need to get the outcomes you want by giving people what they want. A podcast is a great way to do all three. Chuck explains exactly how that works in this podcast and goes deeper as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://devinfluencers.com/apply&#34;&gt;Dev Influencers Accelerator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Panel&lt;/h2&gt;
